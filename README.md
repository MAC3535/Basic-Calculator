Learing

-UIButton -UILabel -Frames and Bounds

In this project you get the chance to create the user interface for an application programmatically. Creating an section of buttons, you are able to build out a button pad for numbers and math operators. 
You create a label to present the numbers being selected by the user. 
Lastly, you are able to experiment with the frame and bounds of mutiple views. Where you get to distinguish frame vs bounds of an object. 

Final Thoughts
Although, the application is a smaller amount of code. It is an important build for beginner developers, becuase it allows you to work on the more technical aspects of how views are created and used within an application, not only in a storyboard. 
You get the discover what it takes to create a simple button, and how it can placed in its parent view. You also learn how all items on a view interact with one another in order to for the main user interface of an application. 
Ovarall, it might not have been the most flashy application, but at the end of the day; it gets the job done.
